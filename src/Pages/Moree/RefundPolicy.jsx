        <h1>Refund Policy</h1>

        <p>
          At <strong>Arvess</strong>, we are committed to delivering structured,
          high-quality consulting and outsourcing services tailored to the needs
          of startups, MSMEs, and growing enterprises. Transparency and
          accountability are core to how we work. Please review this Refund
          Policy carefully to understand the terms under which refunds may
          apply.
        </p>

        <h2>1. General Policy</h2>
        <p>
          All fees paid for Arvess services are non-refundable, unless explicitly
          stated otherwise in writing at the time of engagement. This includes,
          but is not limited to, onboarding fees, consultation charges,
          documentation fees, application filing fees, and service retainers.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Scope-Based Deliverables</h2>
        <p>
          Refunds are not applicable once the agreed scope of work has been
          initiated. This includes services such as:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Pitch deck creation</li>
          <li>Financial projections and reports</li>
          <li>Funding and investment consultation</li>
          <li>Government schemes and grant applications</li>
          <li>Startup certifications (DPIIT, MSME, 80-IAC, etc.)</li>
          <li>Business registration and compliance services</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Once any part of the defined scope is commenced, the associated fees
          shall be considered earned.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Onboarding & Processing Charges</h2>
        <p>
          Onboarding, administrative, and processing charges are collected in
          advance to allocate internal resources, expertise, and timelines.
          These charges are strictly non-refundable, even if the client chooses
          to discontinue services after engagement begins.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Refunds in Case of Ineligibility</h2>
        <p>
          If a specific service includes a refund provision in case of
          ineligibility (such as for certain government certifications or
          schemes), the same must be explicitly mentioned in the signed Service
          Agreement at the time of onboarding.
        </p>

        <p>In such cases:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Refunds, if applicable, will be processed after deducting
            administrative, documentation, and legal charges
          </li>
          <li>
            Refund requests must be raised within 10 days of formal communication
            regarding ineligibility
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. No-Show or Unresponsive Clients</h2>
        <p>
          Clients who fail to respond, do not provide required documents, or
          delay the process beyond 15 working days without prior intimation
          shall not be eligible for any refund. Arvess reserves the right to mark
          such engagements as inactive or closed.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Service Disruption or Internal Errors</h2>
        <p>
          In rare situations where services cannot be delivered due to an
          internal error or technical failure attributable solely to Arvess, a
          partial refund or service credit may be considered. Such cases are
          reviewed individually by the management team, and decisions will be
          final.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Refund Processing Timeline</h2>
        <p>If a refund is approved:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>It will be processed within 7–10 working days</li>
          <li>Refunds will be issued through the original mode of payment</li>
          <li>
            Any applicable bank charges, transaction fees, or platform
            commissions will be deducted
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>
          All refund-related queries or disputes must be submitted in writing to
          the contact details below. If unresolved through mutual discussion,
          disputes shall be subject to the jurisdiction of courts located in
