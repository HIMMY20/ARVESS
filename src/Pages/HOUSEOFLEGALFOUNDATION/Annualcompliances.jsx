            <h4>What does Annual Compliance mean?</h4>
            <p>
              Annual compliance refers to the mandatory statutory filings and legal
              obligations that companies and LLPs are required to complete every financial year to remain legally active.
            </p>
          </div>

            <span className="faq4-no4">02</span>
            <h4>Which entities are required to file annual compliances?</h4>
            <p>
              All registered Private Limited Companies, LLPs, and OPCs must 
              complete annual compliances, even if there has been no business activity during the year.
            </p>
          </div>

            <span className="faq4-no4">03</span>
            <h4>Why is annual compliance necessary?</h4>
            <p>
              Timely compliance helps avoid penalties, keeps the entity in good legal 
              standing, and enhances credibility with banks, investors, and regulatory authorities.

            <h4>What documents are needed for annual compliance?</h4>
            <p>
              Typically required documents include financial statements, bank statements,
              director or partner details, past ROC filings, and relevant tax records.
            </p>

            <h4>What are the consequences of missing annual compliances?</h4>
            <p>
              Failure to comply can result in late fees, heavy penalties, director disqualification,
              loss of company status, or even strike-off by authorities.
