            <h2>What Is Equity Funding?</h2>

            <p>
              Equity funding refers to raising capital by exchanging a portion
              of company ownership for investment. Instead of repaying loans,
              founders partner with investors who provide growth capital to help
              scale the business sustainably and strategically.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <h2>Why founders choose equity funding:</h2>
              <li>No repayment pressure — capital without fixed repayments</li>
              <li>
                {" "}
                Value-driven investor guidance — access to experience, networks,
                and mentorship
              </li>
              <li>
                Accelerated growth & market reach — faster scaling with
                strategic backing

              Equity funding enables startups to raise growth capital by
              offering investors a stake in the business. Instead of repayment
              obligations, founders gain long-term partners who support faster
              expansion and sustainable scaling.
